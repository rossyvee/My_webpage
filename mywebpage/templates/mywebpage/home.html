                    <h4>My First JOb as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>6 months after writing my first Hello World program in January 2022 (while working in the
                        technical business developement department)
                        I collaborated with the product management team to help restructure the landing page of our
                        website and convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better sales CRM </p>
                    <p>
                        Before i knew it we transitioned from the old CRM system and client retention and follow-ups
                        increased by 20%. My newbie self was now in charge of following up on sales and marketing
                        activities hence supporting hundreds of clients.
                    </p>

                    <p>from this you will see that i am someone that is versatile and ready to take challenges</p>

                        Research and building ugly projects first
                    </p>

                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I can
                        break the code where i need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation and
                        tutorials are just a reference.</p>

                    <p>
                       After almost six years of business development I'm ready to learn something new. I will be collaborating and shairing my experience with others through Linkedin and Github
                    </p>
                    <p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where i can be part of a bigger team and learn from others with more experince than myself</p>
